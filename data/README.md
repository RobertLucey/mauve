# Data

Here's some data I've processed so you don't have to

Caveats:
* Generally it's of books where there are more than 10 reviews
* Sentiment only takes 5% of the text cause it takes ages to process. Generally fairly accurate but will work on not having to do this

I'll update whenever an attribute is added or improved
